    <p>Hope and Your Heart
        The mechanism for the connection between health and positivity remains murky, but researchers suspect that
        people who are more positive may be better protected against the inflammatory damage of stress. Another

        long-term goals. Studies also find that negative emotions can weaken immune response.
