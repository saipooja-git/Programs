    <p> This is a list of the world's countries and their dependencies by land, water, and total area, ranked by total
        area.

        Entries in this list include, but are not limited to, those in the ISO 3166-1 standard, which includes sovereign
        states and dependent territories. All 193 member states of the United Nations plus the two observer states are
        given a rank number. Largely unrecognised states not in ISO 3166-1 are included in the list in ranked order. The
        areas of such largely unrecognised states are in most cases also included in the areas of the more widely
        recognised states that claim the same territory; see the notes in the "notes" column for each country for
        clarification.

        Not included in the list are individual country claims to parts of the continent of Antarctica or entities such
        as the European Union[a] that have some degree of sovereignty but do not consider themselves to be sovereign
        countries or dependent territories.

        This list includes three measurements of area:

        Total area: the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines.
        Land area: the aggregate of all land within international boundaries and coastlines, excluding water area.
        Water area: the sum of the surface areas of all inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, and rivers) within
        international boundaries and coastlines.[2] Coastal internal waters may be included. Territorial seas are not
        included unless otherwise noted. Contiguous zones and exclusive economic zones are not included.
